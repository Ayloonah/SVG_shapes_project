HOW TO USE: First, make sure that all the files are in the same folder. Then, in a bash terminal while the project is open, you may type "gcc functions.h jacobsVector.c projectFour.c snowflake.c svgStartEnd.c -Wall" without the quotation marks to compile the program.
As running the program will essentially output HTML code, you may again use a bash terminal to save the output to an HTML file by typing "./projectFour.exe > svg.html" without the quotation marks (replace the executable file name with yours, and you may use whatever name you prefer for the html file).
The html file is there for a preview of the code's results, and the executable file is available for you to be able to test out the code's function without having to compile the program.

Hello,

For my C Programming class in college, I was given the task to use C code to create an SVG illustration of my choosing, with the option to animate it or not, by outputing HTML code. Being originally from Canada and currently suffering from the Floridian heat, I decided to create a snow storm. 

For the second part of the project, we needed to add someone else's code to our own, hence the cuboids which you can see in the background. 

Here are my key learnings from this project:
- I have learned to compile a program that has more than a single file in C.
- I was able to adjust my classmate's code to fit my style and my existing functions.
- I have learned to make use of a header file for my function declarations and to use header guards.
- I have learned a bit of HTML, although not a whole lot, to be able to ensure that this project runs smoothly.
- I have been able to make use of pointers, something that was very confusing to me initially.
